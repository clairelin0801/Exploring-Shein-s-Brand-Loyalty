# From Conscious Threads to Committed Hearts: Exploring Shein's Brand Loyalty

## Abstract
Shein, a global e-retailer, aims to make fashion accessible to a wide range of customers. However, as consumers become more aware of labor practices, social engagement, and sustainability issues, Shein faces challenges in meeting these standards. This research explores the primary factors that drive individuals to become loyal customers of Shein. Through data analysis and insights from 357 participants, the study reveals that brand loyalty is positively influenced by environmental awareness, employee welfare, and social engagement. These relationships are mediated by brand preference, with conscientiousness not acting as a moderator in this model. Based on these findings, suggestions are provided for Shein to enhance its strategies, including implementing responsible disposal programs, obtaining sustainability and employee-related certifications, and ensuring a positive customer experience with consistent quality.
